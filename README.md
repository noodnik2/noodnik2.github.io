## Credits

I found and cloned this template [here](https://html5up.net/forty) due to its awesome look & feel.

Thank you, [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/) for
[publishing this great template under a "Creative Commons" license](https://html5up.net/license)
so that I can use it for my GitHub portfolio!

- For those interested, [here's the original README](./README-original.txt) file that
  accompanied the original template. 

## Development

One of the main reasons I chose this original template and not the corresponding
[GitHub Theme](https://github.com/andrewbanchich/forty-jekyll-theme) that I found
is the ease of local development.  The "Jekyll" version required compilation, which
I found too bothersome.  I don't use Ruby and didn't want to install and configure
the Jekyll, and trying the various Docker images out there that supposedly help me
with that proved to require too much troubleshooting.

So, I'll just click the following link every time I make a change and see if that
change works the way I want prior to promotion to my main branch, causing it to
be put online on GitHub:
